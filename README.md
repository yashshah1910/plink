# Plink ✨

*Save for the future, one plink at a time.*

Plink is a decentralized gifting and savings platform built on the Flow blockchain. It allows parents to create secure, time-locked digital piggy banks ("Stashes") for their children. Family and friends can easily contribute USDC via a simple, shareable link, with each gift being recorded alongside a personal message - creating a permanent, digital memory book for the child's future.

## The Vision

The goal of Plink is to make crypto gifting and long-term saving for loved ones easy, meaningful, and secure. We solve the "Grandma Problem" by abstracting away the complexities of blockchain and providing a simple, joyful user experience. By combining the stability of USDC with the permanence of the Flow blockchain, Plink turns financial gifts into a treasured digital inheritance.

## Key Features

* **Create Time-Locked "Stashes"**: Parents can create secure savings vaults that are locked until a specific date, like a child's 18th birthday.
* **Simple, Sharable Gift Links**: No more copying long wallet addresses. Every Stash has a unique, friendly link for easy gifting.
* **Recurring Gifts**: Givers can set up one-time, monthly, or annual gifts, creating a stable and predictable savings stream.
* **The Digital Memory Book**: Every gift is stored on-chain with a personal message from the giver, creating a permanent record of generosity.
* **Stable Savings**: All Stashes use USDC to ensure that the value of a gift is protected from market volatility.
